            My experience of setting up GitHub began last year. It was 
            needed for a group project exam. Therefore, I was unable to get
             a full rounded experience of it and have enough time to learn 
             what it was all about. However, the urgent need for it made

            <p>
              The creation of the website was an exciting first experience in 
              making websites. However, it was also quite tedious and frustrating
               as I had high ambitions for this assignment that I wanted to 
               achieve but could not because my coding knowledge of html and CSS
                were contained within what we learnt. For example, I wanted to

                As we have learned throughout the lectures on coding, these 
                three dominations work together to create an interactive and 
                visually appealing website. At first, we learned that HTML forms 
                the structure of our website, CSS adds the styling elements to a 
                website (like the colour, size, and position of a heading), and...

                APIs are a very interesting topic that can add significant value 
                and personalization to a website. They broaden the possibilities 
                of what can be done in a website to make it more engaging and

      <h5>Blog Post Week 1</h5>

      <p>
        Experience setting up GitHub: <br>
My experience of setting up GitHub began last year. It was needed for a group project exam. Therefore, I was unable to get a full rounded experience of it and have enough time to learn what it was all about. However, the urgent need for it made me adapt very quickly to some of the features that were required to transfer files and images such as the push and pull request. Although after watching the video on how to use it, I realised it was quite easy to engage with. 
<br>Reflections on the readings:<br>
‘As we may think’ by Bush:
I found this reading very interesting in its discussion of how science was introduced to a new way of thinking realising that it had only been used so far to increase the physicality of humans rather than increase the way our minds worked. It catered more to our physical needs than our mental needs. 
The more intriguing part of this reading however was that Bush spoke on things that did not exist when his paper was written but rather came to fruition in the future. Many of the ideas he discusses that would take science to another level of expanding our minds exist today. I think it is very important to note that because the people of his day were faced with exceeding amounts of knowledge but had no solid way of storing it and building upon it, Bush took it upon himself to generate futuristic ideas that ended up being solutions to this problem of not getting knowledge to the people that required it. 
‘The Library of Babel’ by Borges:
The library of Babel felt like a journey reading it. It took a new approach to explaining the concept of philosophical issues like the nature of the universe, meaning, reason, and infinite knowledge in a metaphorical way. It really makes one think how we function in a universe with an endless supply of knowledge. 
This reading is similar to the first in that they both address knowledge and how vastly filled our universe is with it. However, Borges’s reading shows us that our universe is filled with an insurmountable number of ideas that also have their own variations depending on the type of people, the culture and understanding, as well as the values of these individuals. For example, the idea of the colour red/meaning behind the colour red can have so many different meanings depending on the context and group of people. Therefore, showing us that every idea, every piece of knowledge, and every combination/variation of that idea/knowledge already exists within our universe. 
<br>My goals for this course:<br>
My goals for this course are to gain a deeper understanding of how the web works and use that knowledge to create websites and apps that deeply move as well as impact the users.

      <p>My experience starting with HTML:
        <br>
        The topic of coding is associated with nervousness and being scared of failure for me. I have a fear of not being able to grasp the concepts of whatever coding language it is I am learning about which would lead me to falling behind as a result of my experience with C# last year. However, starting HTML has me confident that I have a good understanding of it so far and will grow in my knowledge of it as we continue to learn about it. I have come to realise that HTML is simple in that its concepts can be clearly understood but complex in that such simple concepts used together can create marvellous websites. 
       <br> Reflections on the readings:
        <br>
        ‘Why You Should Choose HTML5’ by B, Lawson:
        This reading was very informative about article and section. It explained very clearly the functions of article and section as well as why the first one is more preferable than the latter. Through this particular reading I have gained insight into how many components of HTML can be very similar at surface value but they most certainly are very different when you go beyond the surface. I think that it is important to realise that when choosing between similar components in HTML we should lean towards the one that will serve the purpose more effectively. The one that will benefit both the user and the designer(me) while also taking the website to the next level. The components that we choose should add value to our websites. 
        ‘How a Screen Reader User Accesses The Web’ by B, Lawson:
        The knowledge that I have gained from this makes me realise how shocking it is that I never questioned or thought about how people who have certain disabilities are able to access/use a website that is mostly catered to people, like myself, whose physicality is completely functional. Therefore, it is very helpful and interesting to hear from a person with a disability on how we as website designers can create websites that are usable to everyone. I think it is important to remember that anyone and everyone will eventually come across your website so it is your responsibility as the designer to make a website that is accessible but more significantly user-friendly to all people. Not only will this gain more users, but it will help improve your website in its usability. 
       <br> Reflection on Internet Histories:
        <br>
        It was mind-blowing to see how far back the internet started and realise that every idea that came to fruition enabled the internet to exist. It was also interesting to see that although every idea was an intellectual one, the next ‘thing’ to come out in the years that followed got increasingly better as well as more advanced. An important point for me was that as the internet and technology got more advanced, each creation was well-suited and adaptable for the time that it was made.

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
It has been quite the journey as well as a significant learning curve for me. I planned out a beautiful and intricate wireframe for my website, therefore I was excited to get started. However, as I started bringing my idea to life with coding I ran into a few issues. The practicality of my design was just not there. It was pleasing to the eye, but the layout had no room to function. My solution to these problems was to look at examples of good websites and seek out the features, designs, and practicalities that made these websites great. 
<br>Reflection on the reading and lecture: 
<br>
The lecture for this week on the world wide web and interaction was knowledgeable. It was very interesting to learn how much of a significant role interaction plays in the world wide web as well as our own websites. It is the experience of the interaction on both sides that determine whether a website is considered good or not. If a website provides easy, accessible, and cohesive ways of interacting with it the user will very much enjoy their experience and time spent on it. However, if it is not then the user would rather leave the website than struggle to navigate it. 
Following through from my points above leads into how truly great a role UI and UX play in the design of a website. The reading explains how important making use of conventions are when creating, because it allows your users to understand what it is they are looking at and how to use it. I personally understand how difficult it is to keep yourself from adding new aspects to a website so that your personality may shine through it or so that it may tie into the ‘’theme’’ of your website but it is important to remember that new aspects an overwhelm the user as well as confuse them making the interaction difficult. Therefore, we should keep the users in mind when creating our websites. Our users are not with us when we are building our websites so if we surprise them with things that stray away from convention, we end up pushing them away from engaging with the website. For example, having the navigation bar at the top of the screen to the right is a convention that most websites use. Thus, we should have a similar setup to our websites. 
Mailloux mentions in his reading that conventions should also be applied to the appropriate context. For example, using the layout of Instagram for a website about a donut shop is not a convention that is appropriate for its context. However, using a layout that is common for food places/donut shops/cafes would be significantly more appropriate and related to its context. This shows us the huge role that convention and context play in creating a useable and readable website as well as how good use of UI and UX makes the user aware of what the website is showcasing and how to engage with it.

      <h5>Blog Post Week 4</h5>

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
I have a lot of different ideas about what I want the homepage of my website to look like and so I created a few wireframes that explore these ideas. I have so many ideas as I want to impress the user right from the point of entering my website since first impressions determine how your user will feel and experience the rest of the webpages. There is a lingering thought that I have about the website as a whole: I want my website to be cohesive and look like all the pages belong together so I may decide to use the same/similar layout throughout the website. However, I am considering using different background images for each page. Although, this might take away the cohesive design I was aiming for. 
How do my wireframes hold against the readings and lectures on UI: 
I have realised that some of my wireframes may be too complicated as they display beautiful layouts that I feel are out of my reach of achieving within my website especially since this is the first website I have ever created. I do realise that I need to make complete changes to some of my wireframes by simplifying them into something that I can create. The readings and lectures on UI truly emphasized the importance of the user and highlighted for me that the website should be designed to suit the user and their needs instead of parading my own desires and wants for the website. This is not to say that I will eradicate all my desires for the website but rather that I need to find a balance between incorporating my desires with the needs and interests of the user. 
After analysing my wireframes, I realised that they were not user-friendly at all. They were quite difficult and complicated. This realisation came after I did the reading on ‘The Basic Principles of User Interface Design’ which states that the UI should be easily interactable for the user. The user should not have to strive and work tediously to understand or get the website to work. When the user is using the website that engagement should be smooth like butter. It should require little to no effort from the user. My wireframes did not incorporate this concept and so they need to be changed. 
<br>How does the UI relate to interactivity:
<br>
Without good UI there will be no good interaction. Hence why the UI of a website needs to be functional in that it responds to the input that the user provides. It should also be easy to understand and navigate so that the user is not required to work hard to achieve the output that they desire. Therefore, UI and interactivity go hand in hand as the UI needs to be great for the interactivity to be great as well. 
<br>Reflection on the readings:
<br>
The reading that I did was eye-opening in its content on user interface. As mentioned above I did the reading on ‘The Basic Principles of User Interface Design’. It really assisted me in the understanding of UI and helped me in realising that my wireframes were too complicated for me to implement. The reading truly engraved into my mind and thinking process that when designing a website, we must create it for the intended audience as well as catering to their needs. It showed me that good UI would make the engagement effortless and enjoyable for the user. 
I believe that a website does not have to be a copy and paste of the layout that necessarily suits that content. For example, a profile website does not need to follow the normal layout. It can be created differently, but it must contain the aspects that make it a profile like including an ‘About Me’ page or a profile section that informs your users who you are and what it is that you do. It should also contain a page that showcases off some of the work that you have done.

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
Last week I mentioned that I had quite a few ideas for the layout of my 
homepage. This week however I am glad to say that I decided on a simple design 
and the wireframing process was a great help in assisting me with my choice. 
I also stated that I wanted to use different background images for each webpage,
 but after much thought and deliberation I have decided to stick with one 
 background image throughout the whole website as it makes it more cohesive 
 and seamless. I believe that it will create this unity between the pages of 
 my website. Making use of one background throughout will also keep the 
 user’s attention on the content within the pages as they do not have to 
 adjust to seeing a new background every time they move to a new page. 
 This week I simplified my wireframes by completely changing the layouts 
 and design decisions as they were very much complicated for a first-time
  website.

      <h5>Blog Post Week 7</h5>

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
The process of creating my website has started to slow down this week due to other workloads I have had as well as personal life which I cannot really control. However, I am happy to say that I have a homepage that just needs to be styled and functional. All I have right now is the basic structure of it. It is quite a joyous experience seeing my ideas come to life and work in the way that I intended them too. I also have a ‘’theme’’ that I am going to be using throughout my website which I believe will really allow the user to meet me. By this I mean the ‘’theme’’ will convey a part of my personality and character. This ties in beautifully with the concept of creating a profile website as even some of my design choices will allow the user to get to know me. 
I am going to strive to work harder this week so that I may be able to get more work done on my website and hopefully my vision for the other pages will work smoothly with the homepage and each other. 
<br>IxD Process mashup lecture slides:<br>
The lecture slides were very informative on what is needed for the website. As mentioned above I was not able to work on my website as much as I would have liked too so most of the things mentioned in the slides I do not have. However, there are a few things like the design process, wireframing process, and goal alignment that I do have for each page in my website. I also have some of the information structure written down, but I still need to map it out. There may be a few things that I need to change so my website can accommodate the user and their needs. 
An important aspect that I need to update is the hierarchy of elements within the website. I need to move the most important aspects to the top of the page so that the user understands what is more important and less important on the website. However, I also want the structure of my homepage to follow the order that is present on the navigation bar as this will ensure that the user knows what is next when they are scrolling through the homepage. 
<br>Reflection on this week’s reading:<br>
This week’s reading explained meticulously that the user experience (UX) is more than the ‘’cognitive and task-orientated’’ and rather have roots that go deeper than that. It is about the emotional connection that forms between the user and website, the individual journey that the user goes on when traversing through your website. User experience cannot be centred around its usability/instrumentality because a user would not want to be engaging with something that has no meaning behind it. The UX of a website should be stimulating and satisfying an underlying human need such as the pursuit of knowledge or growing in their understanding of certain concepts. In our case, we are making a profile website, the underlying need would be to get to know who we are and what we are about from our website.
Therefore, we should put ourselves into the user’s shoes so that we may try to understand what their experience will be like when they engage with our websites.

      <p>Reflection on the website (assignment one):</p>
      <p>The creation of the website was an exciting first experience in making websites. However, it was also quite tedious and frustrating as I had high ambitions for this assignment that I wanted to achieve but could not because my coding knowledge of html and CSS were contained within what we learnt. For example, I wanted to include a feature where users would be able to press a button that would open documents like my blog posts or wireframes in the webpage that they were on but had no idea of how to implement it and so I stuck to keeping it as simple as possible. I think what went wrong for me is I did not give myself enough time to include all that I wanted to for the website because I was more attentive to the attractiveness of the website and thus had less time to make it as responsive as I wanted it to be. Overall, my website turned out like what I envisioned especially for the visual design aspects. This was important as I was trying to convey my goal and aim for this website through the visuals. 
        I will allocate more time to the aspects that make a website responsive and functional for the next time I shall create a website. As was mentioned in the lecture there is no point to the website if it is pretty but unresponsive.
        </p>

        <p>Reflection on the two readings:</p>
        <p>The reading on information geographies explains how the information provided by the platform it is searchable on can be a representation of the place that is not true. This means that the information provided on the place by other sources other than the true source itself does not present the entirety of the place to others. Instead, it creates its own idea/context of the place which is then consumed by users thereby forming the user’s understanding of the place as well as their knowledge. However, the reading also brings to our attention how information and communication technologies are unfairly distributed in that they are not equal because of the influence of power and money as well as the geography of them.  
          The second reading discusses how search engines are so powerful and influential in shaping our understanding of the world around us and can then enforce power dynamics that already exist but also create new ones. It shows us how search engines like Google can alter the way we think by pushing the information and knowledge they want us to receive from the things we want to know. The reading also explains how there is a bias within the results of information generated by these powerful search engines that users are engaging with daily. This obviously has positives and negatives to it. For example, if a user searches bed and breakfast places near them, search engines like google will bring up the popular places instead of new businesses first. This is bad for the new business as not very many people will know about them, but it will be good for popular businesses as they will receive more business. Therefore, showing the power dynamics that search engines push as well as the influence they have over the world. 
          Both readings explain how information and communication technologies and geography can shape and affect how we think as well as what we come to value and know about the people and world around us.

          <h5>Blog Post Week 9</h5>
          <p>Continuation of my website: </p>
          <p>The information that I included in my website was not done in the best possible way. If I think about it now the way in which I implemented the information into my website was not done keeping the user in mind. It is overwhelmingly burdening the user with what looks like a lot of information. The exercises have also showed me how to make use of the space in my website efficiently as well as how to keep my layout neat and easily accessible for the user. I really liked learning about the overflow aspect and how to nip problems of overflow in the bud because it was a prominent issue that faced in my own website. </p>
    
            <p>Close reading of ‘Digital Inequalities and why they matter’:</p>
            <p>“Digital inequality is one of the most prominent of these new forms, as it has the potential to shape life chances in multiple ways.” This quote from the reading truly stood out to me because in one sentence the writer manages to capture the lasting impact of the digital world as well as how severe the consequences	can be for people who are on the other side of the spectrum. This quote concisely explains how drastic the impact of the digital age is on the very life and livelihoods of people. The reading pertaining to this quote also informs us that the people who can adapt and function successfully in the digital world are the ones who are at an advantage in the life of the digital age compared to the people who struggle to understand/adapt to it. This conveys to us that if people have difficulty navigating the digital then it has a domino effect on their lives affecting them in all that they do.
              The reading also mentions how health care has been improved, however, it also shows us how things like eHealth are not accessible to everyone. The quote ‘’disadvantaged social groups, who have the heaviest burden of poor health would also mean the lack of skills and access to navigate healthcare systems like eHealth’’ explain the severity and exclusion of people who are not per se ‘privileged’ in the digital age. This contrast emphasises how inequalities in life transfer to becoming inequalities in the realm of technology, therefore meaning that people who are disadvantaged in other areas of life are usually disadvantaged in the use and access to technology. This is a grave problem as the advancement of technology does not cater for the people who probably need it the most to improve their lifestyles as they miss out on services like healthcare, job opportunities and connection. 
              A key aspect that the reading mentions is how ethnic and racial minority groups use the internet less than the racial majority groups. This reiterates how the racial majority groups have the upper hand/more power than minority groups in the technological realm as they do in everyday life. This conveys how digital inequality goes deeper than the surface of just remaining within the boundary of the digital age. It informs us how digital inequality stems from the deeply rooted disadvantages that people experience in life outside of the digital.

              <p>What changes I made to incorporate JavaScript:</p>
              <p>I have not incorporated any changes yet to my website using JavaScript as I am not sure where to start. However, I have been looking at ways to increase the functionality of my website. For example, instead of having simple links to different pages in my website I want to make use of buttons. This will also provide a cleaner look as the writing of the buttons will not have the underline. The JS lectures also have given me new ideas on how to structure the layout of my website so that it will become more efficient and cohesive. JavaScript objects are also going to be very helpful in my website especially when I want to add specific things to my website. </p>
        
                <p>Reflection on the reading, ‘The Road to Techno colonialism’:</p>
                <p>The reading on ‘Road to Techno Colonialism’ speaks on very important and interesting topics. The reading explores the idea of how developed countries with fast-advancing technologies like the US and China when supplying these technologies to developing countries can ultimately lead to techno colonialism as it creates a power dynamic between the two. The position of power belongs to the developed countries and the position of dependent belongs to the developing countries. This does not necessarily mean that developing countries chose this position willingly. However, they did ‘’willingly’’ accept help from developed countries for the betterment and advancement of their country. 
                  The reading also conveys to us how although there may be beneficial aspects of this dynamic, it still has its inequality associated with it. This relationship benefits both parties, although the reading makes us aware that it benefits the countries with the power more. The reason for this is that these power-holding countries will be able to exert their control over the countries that seek help from them, meaning that they can control significant aspects of the country like media and obviously the technology. For example, in South Africa, platforms like google and Facebook play a significant role in their influence of the digital advertising industry. 
                  There are two very noticeable reasons as to why developing countries must turn to, as the reading puts them ‘AI Superheroes’, developed countries like the US and China. The first reason is that these countries have highly successful and influential companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and many more that seep their imprint into a vast number of countries. This already gives them the upper hand in producing new, advanced technologies as the resources are handed to them thereby giving them power that many other countries do not have. The second reason is that developing countries do not have proper infrastructure to create advancing technology like AI systems that they can call their own. These countries do not want to be at a disadvantage and so they start depending on powerful countries to ensure growth and security in today’s world for their country.

                  <p>The continuation of my development process:</p>
                  <p> How CSS relates to HTML and JS:
                    As we have learned throughout the lectures on coding, these three dominations work together to create an interactive and visually appealing website. At first, we learned that HTML forms the structure of our website, CSS adds the styling elements to a website (like the colour, size, and position of a heading), and JavaScript gives more functionality and interactivity to the website, thereby making it more appealing and simpler to engage with by the users. For example, having little animations on a website happens because of JS. This feature would add more character to a website. Without CSS, the website would feel incomplete, lacking creativity and substance, so it is vital to include it when building a website. It is significant in determining how HTML elements would be displayed on a page. 
                    The benefits and challenges of responsive design:
                    Responsive design is a necessary and magical aspect to have within a website. Watching the lecture on responsive design showed me the significance of including it in my website, as it would improve the user experience and engagement with my website. 
                    I believe the challenges of responsive design sit in the implementation of it. Adding aspects of responsive design to a website requires careful planning to keep the goal behind the website the same, as well as user experience easy and friendly. In my website, I struggled to include responsive design as my layout became a jumble when the device used to view it became smaller. So, it meant that if a user were to view my website on a phone, the navigation and readability of the website would be very confusing and difficult for the user to engage with. I also encountered the challenge of deciding what aspects of my website would get the first preview and space and which elements I could hide when viewed from a smaller screen. Therefore, it is vital to remember that the user’s experience comes before my need to have every aspect of my website set in stone the way I want. If the idea does not work, it is better to create a new one, so the user gets the best out of their journey through the website.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>Reflection of the lecture ‘Our Code Matters’:</p>
                    <p>This was a very eye-opening lecture. It never occurred to me that something as small as the way we code and what we decide to code could have such a significant impact on people. It is a very natural thing to follow the norms of how we create and engage with things therefore we do not really question if what we are doing is the best for everyone. 
                      This lecture has shown me that real-life issues that people face are so deeply embedded in society and the way that we think that it ends up displaying itself in practical areas like coding. Even in code we manage to create barriers and exclusion between those who can traverse our websites with ease and comfort and those who cannot as we forget to cater for them. This is a very thought-provoking topic that desperately needs to be addressed with more attention being given to it. When a decision is not made with intention it provokes us to ask the question of whether we are being neutral or not. It is not ideal to be neutral as we just increase the scope/intensity of the problem at hand which is excluding marginalised groups even from the web. 
                      As I go through the process of making my own website, I am trying to question each decision that I make as well as understanding how what I code could affect the people using my website. When I began this journey the main goal of my website was to create a space where users could be at ease and feel included by relating to some of the content and ideas presented. Therefore, through every decision that I make, I ensure that my website can be different from the rest.

     <p>API’s:</p>
       <p>APIs are a very interesting topic that can add significant value and personalization to a website. They broaden the possibilities of what can be done in a website to make it more engaging and relatable for the user. For example, YouTube APIs allow a developer to include YouTube videos to their website.
          YouTube videos are a very interesting aspect that I am thinking of adding to my website. The idea that I had was to include a video that documents how I added a specific part to my website. For example, I could include a video that explains how to create a contact page in a website. I believe that adding this will show my users that I make use of all resources available to me ensuring I have a polished final product.
           Another idea that I had was adding little animations like clicking a button to make the website more enjoyable for the user or allowing a small animation/gif pop-up after a user has successfully done something on the website. This will create a reward system that could keep users intrigued and excited to traverse through the rest of my website. 
      </p>
                
       <p>Reflection on ‘Travelling while trans’ reading:</p>
       <p>This reading was an insightful one. Readings like this provide us with much needed knowledge of what groups of marginalised people experience in their day-to-day lives when undergoing processes that should be normal but are not because they are different thereby providing us with an understanding of the challenges, they face through what should be considered simple like the airport security checks. 
          The quote ‘’how larger systems – including norms, values, and assumptions – are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems’’ (Costanza-Chock 2020: 4) from the reading truly makes us aware of how deeply the exclusion and barriers for marginalized people run. It explains to us how these systems are not created for people who are different and therefore places them in situations of feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed. It creates this inequality turning things that are supposed to be normal into things that become challenging as well as nerve-wracking for marginalised groups like trans people. The reading also reminds me of how even in our own coding and creations we should remember that every small decision whether intentional or not has a ripple effect. It can honestly be the deciding factor of whether we become part of the problem or part of the solution. 
          The reading displays that the decisions that went into creating this security system check were not done so considering everyone but rather followed the norms and so naturally excludes people who do not fall under this norm. It puts into perspective how there is so much weight put onto every decision that we as creators make.

    <p>Assignment 2 – Essay (Ethics, UI, UX, and Interaction)</p>
    <p>I will be discussing the user experience and user interface of the ‘YouVersion’ website. This website is based around the bible app that many people including me use on a day-to-day basis. I will define what UX and UI are in terms of websites leading into the UX/UI used for the ‘YouVersion’ website and how it impacts the user.
     User experience and user interaction are two different concepts that intertwine to create a journey for the user. User experience is what the user receives and then processes from their interaction with the websites. For example, a website can elicit negative or positive emotions from the user depending on the context and meaning behind the website. They gain this experience from their interaction with the product. User interface is how the person engages with the website. (Singh 2022) However, for this to be a possibility the website itself needs to be interactive, and something is only interactive when it requires little to no effort, does not fully control, is not fully controlled, as well as allows for there to be a change in text/shape. For example, if there is a button that says, ‘read more’ and the user clicks it, the button should take the user to the place on the website where the complete text is available. That would therefore enable user interaction as the user inputted an action that returned a result. 
      I decided to discuss this website specifically because it is quite known how great the impact of religious websites can be on their target audience and even on people who are not part of that audience. I believe that this lasting impact of religious websites changes the trajectory of user experience and user interface when compared to regular websites like clothing and food websites. A key feature of these websites is being easily navigable as well as purely simple so that all who use it will be solely focused on the role/message of the websites rather than being bombarded with information and trying to figure out how to engage with the website. The first aspect I noticed about this website is the video/animation that is constantly playing on the home page. This can be very distracting to the users while they are making themselves familiar with the website. However, the video represents community and joy which enforces the message of using the bible apps the website is promoting. Therefore, triggering an emotional response in the user and so making an impression that stays with the user even after they leave the website. Emotion is a determining factor of user interface which is driven by the user experience making this aspect suitable for this type of website. (Gruenewald 2008)
      The next important point that I want to speak on for this website are the text and the buttons. Text and buttons as well as their style has a significant impact on the emotional response that is attained from the user when they interact with the website. Text if not used in the right font for the specific context can make a user uncomfortable alongside being difficult to read. The same notion applies to buttons. If buttons are not styled keeping the message/context of the website in mind they can confuse the user triggering emotions that were not supposed to be triggered. For example, if the buttons on a website are more rounded it exudes friendliness and gentleness.</p>
         
    <p>. In the ‘YouVersion’ website the buttons are rounded emphasising the friendliness but also the mission that the website stands for which is gentleness, kindness, love, and community. The text is large, bold, and easily readable so that users do not have to strain themselves in trying to figure out what the content is saying. The website creates a comfortable atmosphere in which the user does not need to use maximum levels of effort to navigate/engage with. The buttons are also fully functional and take the user to the place on the website that they wish to browse. This is an example of great user interface as it makes the interaction between user and website efficient. Thereby eliciting appreciation from the user as they do not have to struggle in finding the things they want to. (Gruenewald 2008)
     A beautiful integration of the hover and highlighting text aspect is another part of what I believe makes this a good website. The words that follow the video on the homepage such as ‘’Our Products’’ gets highlighted when the user hovers over it indicating that it can be interacted with. As insinuated by the highlighting the text is interactable as it takes the user to the products page when it’s clicked. This is good user interface as it informs the user of exactly whether something is interactable by highlighting it and somewhat prompts the user to click on it. This is a good tactic as people are generally curious therefore by highlighting something it indicates that it does something which means the user will naturally want to see what happens when they do click on the text/button. Another important quality of this website that leads to good user interface is the mini drop-down menus that appear when a user hovers the mouse over the text in the main navigation bar. This is good user interface as it reduces the work the user must put into browsing the website by showing the user what falls under each section. Therefore, improving the user experience. This simple navigation makes it pleasing for the user and so enjoyable which means the user is likely to visit the website again. This extra detail that they added makes the website suitable for users who may be new to the faith as it provides the information it needs to concisely and allows them to engage with the things that they want to know more about in the most efficient way. Thus, allowing users who are both new and old to the faith to journey through the website with ease and peace. (Gruenewald 2008)
     The layout of the website is the same throughout which I believe also adds to the experience and interaction of the user. Looking at the ‘Mission’ page it has a main picture at the top and then following that is a little excerpt that explains what ‘YouVersion’ is all about. The page has a few more images that are placed in circles which exudes the friendliness and approachability that the website offers. This layout is very clear as the function of each section in the page allowing the user a seamless navigation of the page as well as a quick one to. This page is also a good example of keeping information concise, short and sweet, as this does not burden the user with a lot of reading and processing what they just read. Instead, it makes use of short sentences that the user will be able to understand. This also ensures that the pages are not messily busy and overstimulating for the user. Each page is highly interactive as well because they all contain buttons that lead the user to other pages or sections within the website. This creates a solid experience for the user while still being informative on what each page is and the topics it discusses. Personally, navigating these pages was very easy on the eyes and mind. The simple design and layout allowed me to remember all that was on each page so that if I wanted to go back to a certain topic, </p>
      
    <p>, I would know which page to return to. Making the input from the user’s side effortless. (Gruenewald 2008)
    A specific part of the website I want to speak about is the stories section. The stories section is very impactful on the emotional and mental side of the user. Again, like all the other sections this one is easily locatable. This part of the website provides a little piece of the story thereby prompting the user to want to read more. The user can click on the person’s name which would then transport the user to a YouTube video. I believe this is great interface as it takes the user to another webpage without any trouble so that they may experience the richness and fullness that these stories bring. This is great user interface as the user is taken straight to the video itself instead of having to find the video for themselves. This would make the user more likely to watch the video and therefore learn more about how impactful this service has been to other people. Thus, enriching the user’s experience and mind with this added feature. I believe that this feature is truly successful in evoking strong, raw emotion from the user which they will then relate to the website. All these features together will bring the user back because it stimulates them in various ways. (Gruenewald 2008)
    Particularly for this website I believe the ethics of the interaction is truly honest and good in what they try to get their users to engage in and with. It is a religious website that supports and stands for values like love, community, humility, and kindness. I believe that this shows how friendly and honest their interactions would be. The designer truly took into consideration how user-friendly their designs would be. The designer clearly ensured that the website was simple to use for people of all backgrounds and of all levels in their faith. This is highly significant as it ensures that all people get a well-rounded and enjoyable experience from using their website. The aim of the website is to provide ways to draw people closer to God and so the designer keeping it simple, coordinated, and seamless for the users would achieve this as more people will be drawn in by the authenticity and conciseness of the website. I believe that the designer tried to echo the values of Christianity into the design of the website deliberately making use of aspects like the rounded buttons, large text, and circles conveying that friendliness and gentleness. Therefore, the ethics of the interaction were done with good intent. (Gruenewald 2008)
                                                                                                                        Word count: 1687

    <p>Final Exam Essay</p>
    <p>Introduction:</p>
     <p>In the essay below I will be discussing how algorithmic cultures and AI impact the internet using the statement released by CAIS as a starting point for this argument. The statement is a single sentence stating how significant the risk of extinction from AI is that it should be considered a priority alongside life-changing events like pandemics and nuclear war. The CAIS (Centre for AI Safety) released this statement which speaks volumes because a safety centre produced such a powerful statement that has received both positive and negative reactions. The statement had over 350 people who signed it which included AI experts, people who have had a hand in creating AI, alongside scholars, philosophers, physicists, and many others. The statement provides a space that opens discussion on the severe risks that AI carries with it informing people that even experts in this field are taking the risks that AI poses seriously. (CAIS 2023)
     <p> What is Algorithmic Culture and AI:</p> 
      <p>Algorithmic culture is a vast concept that can most likely be found in every aspect of the internet. ‘’Algorithmic culture is the historical process through which computational processes are used to organize human culture.’’ (Carah,2017) The quote means that humans have assigned the organization of history, people, places, events, and things to the technological world. The internet now has the potential to judge and make decisions in the way that a human would. An example of an algorithm could be how Netflix recommends movies/series based on what you have already watched. It uses the amount of engagement you have with a genre like teen drama/romantic comedies to suggest things that have similar aspects. (Carah,2017) Algorithms have become necessary in the production and consumption of information on the internet. They have such a strong influence that they shape how we think and process information by shaping cultural norms/ideas and challenging our values, beliefs, and morals.  AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. “Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.” (Burns, 2023) An example of AI is ChatGPT, which is a chatbot that can answer questions that are mostly language related. The CAIS states eight risks that AI poses to society some of which will be used in the discussions below.</p>
     <p>How does algorithmic culture and AI impact the internet:</p> 
    <p>Algorithmic culture and AI have a significant impact on the internet in how information is created, produced, and processed. As mentioned above algorithmic culture and AI have a stronghold on society's culture. The reason for this is that they can personalize things like recommendations and search results to provide the seemingly best-suited results for the user in question. However, this can create limitations and act as a form of bias as not everything possible is being shown to the user. (Carah,2017) For example, if a user is constantly searching for pictures of roses, they are most likely to encounter advertising, feeds on social media, and search results that bring up information about roses or at least have some relation to roses. This creates a limit in what the user experiences when they are on the internet as well as a bias because the algorithms provide the user with content that it believes is something the user will appreciate. These algorithms feed users what it believes they want to see. Algorithmic culture lends a hand to creating a hierarchy within the internet space. This can be seen in the way that highly liked posts and videos on the internet are continuously circulating and put onto the feed of users who do not usually engage with such content so that these posts and videos may accumulate more popularity and interaction. Another great example of this falls under search engines. When a user searches for something like a scholarly paper, or a website of some kind, the search engine brings up the papers and websites that are most interacted/engaged with. It is usually on the last page that smaller and less popular ones are found. (Orgad) As a result, this means that users are constantly interacting with these increasing their popularity, likeability, and user interaction. So, while these are getting more known throughout the internet, the less popular ones are losing their place in the internet world and are not being allowed to be seen or experienced. However, despite this, algorithms create a good user experience because it personalizes so much of the content and information users receive.  Therefore, algorithms (algorithmic culture) have a significant impact on what users experience and gain from the internet.
      AI is an ambivalent concept. It has many benefits but alongside it comes the risks of AI. Artificial intelligence is propelling the internet world ahead giving us applications like Google maps, Siri, and ChatGPT. All these applications prove very helpful everyday life. As the Orgad reading mentions the internet is “increasingly integrated into the fabric of everyday life.” (Orgad 2007, 34) This quote informs us how intricately intertwined the internet has become with users’ lives. However, it also shows that the internet serves a prominent role in everything that we do. From finding our ways to certain locations, assisting us in answering the many questions that we have as well as providing us with solutions to coding mishaps to acting as a companion, the use of AI has transformed the internet space into a realm where users have everything they need to know and want to know at their fingertips. Although, despite how advanced AI is, it still makes use of algorithms to perform the functions it was created to do. This means that current cultures that algorithms have created will reflect through the AI as well, further influencing the way we work, communicate, and think. This helps us understand that AI and algorithms work simultaneously. For example, AI algorithms play a vital role in online advertising by making use of user data to create personalised ads based on several factors like browsing history, location, and background information. This can be considered a disadvantage though because it raises concerns of user privacy and how easy it is to access their personal information. One of the risks of AI that I found interesting was the risk of spreading misinformation. The CAIS website states that AI could create pervasive arguments that could evoke powerful emotional responses from users. (CAIS 2023) This could create unnecessary commotion and derail moral progress by creating reactions to falsified information. 
      Although there are quite a few disadvantages to the impact that algorithmic culture and AI have on the internet and thereby its users, it also provides many advantages which can be seen through how advanced technology and the internet has become. One of the disadvantages of algorithmic culture and AI was the personalisation of content like ads, videos, and websites that are provided to users based on what they interact with and other contributing factors. (Carah,2017) However, this can be considered a very prominent advantage for the very reason that it improves user experience and usually provides content that the user is familiar with and enjoys. It also means that irrelevant content does not overwhelm the user through their internet journey simplifying their experience. Another advantage pertaining specifically to AI applications is the use of chatbots that assists both in personal life and academic life too. For example, chatbots like ChatGPT can assist students in writing essays, reviews, as well as assisting in coding problems. It does this by learning from algorithms and obtaining its content from information that already exists on the internet. (Burns 2023)AI notably improves the accessibility of the internet for people with disadvantages by providing technology like speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion ensuring the inclusion of disadvantaged people. These technologies make it easier for such people to access the internet and use it in an efficient way. Lastly, a very significant advantage of AI and algorithmic culture is the role they play in cybersecurity. AI algorithms can strengthen security measures by finding and preventing a variety of online threats and attacks including malware and fraud. This creates a safety net for users and companies from agents that want to use the internet for unethical reasons. </p>
     <p>Ethical internet and its relationship to algorithmic culture and AI:</p> 
    <p>The disadvantages of algorithmic cultures and AI mentioned above leads us to the question if there is space for ethical internet to exist. Firstly, ethical internet or the ethics of the internet refer to the role that the internet plays in creating equal and safe spaces for users to exist within expressing a range of topics and discussions like politics, education, global-scale events, and issues that affect our societies alongside serving as a space that can help build communities and relations between users of all backgrounds. However, with the reasons mentioned above of how algorithmic culture and AI impact the internet in both a negative and positive light, there stills seems to be room for improvement. Both the ‘The Virtual Sphere: the internet as a public sphere’ and the ‘The Internet as a Moral Space’ readings raise the concerns of how the internet controls its users in a way that it produces, creates, and distributes the content that users see and engage with. (Orgad 2007) The internet although it brings about significant ways for users to engage with one another, work, research, and find entertainment as well as create spaces for serious discussions also has its limitations. The very nature of how the internet works is through algorithms and AI. These tools act as a filter of what users are recommended and what they are more likely to engage in. The fact that it was created in a capitalist era means that it does not solely exist to make the lives of its users easier, but it also exists to generate power, profit, and influence for the people/companies that already have power and control in society. (Papachrissi 2002)
      The advancement of the internet has also made it possible for actors/agents to use it for harm, violence, and propaganda in how it can change the way people think, how they act, and what they believe in. An example, of this is political parties/individuals using the internet as a platform to encourage others to follow what their morals, values, and beliefs. (CAIS 2023) This is where AI can be deemed a huge risk as well. AI can cause enfeeblement and be used for weaponization. Our society is relying heavily on technology for a variety of things like online shopping, directions, advice, assistance in academics and many more. This reliability on the internet can be dangerous as society can end up fully relying on it taking away the very nature of what it is to be human. AI can be made “highly destructive by malicious actors which presents an existential risk” (CAIS 2023) which explains how detrimental AI can be when placed in the wrong hands. There are many more of such examples and risks that the internet brings to society which makes one wonder if ethical internet could truly exist in its entirety. These examples show us that there are always going to be disadvantages and problems in these systems, so it is difficult for the internet to be a truly ethical, inclusive, and safe place for society. </p>
     <p>Conclusion:</p> 
     <p> We have learnt from the above discussion that algorithmic culture and AI work together to create the advanced space in which people can interact, work, and have platforms that assist them in conveying their values and views of society. We know that the advancement of the internet comes with many advantages as it does disadvantages and the impact that it has on our lives displays how mighty as well as influential it is in them. Therefore, the statement released by the CAIS is very valid and necessary indeed. Majority of our lives are governed by technology and being mindful of the developing control and power the continuous advancement of things like AI will bring in the future has to keep us weary and alert that we do not let it take complete control of our lives and society but also that we do not let the fears hold us back from using it for good.
