        Goal alignment for my website:<br />
        My goal for this website is to efficiently convey to the users more
        about me as this is a profile website and its main purpose is for the
        users to get to know who you are and what you are about. However, I do
        not want to make it just factual and boring for the user and for myself.
        I want the user to be able to engage with my website and feel more
        connected to it through their experience of it but I want them to at the
        end of their journey know more about me and my website. Regarding this
        website the target audience/user would be people who want to get to know
        more about you either because you are starting a new business, or they
        are looking for people to hire. A website like this one is more about
        giving a good first impression so that the user may take away the type
        of character you have as well as the skills and passion you possess. the
        content of my website is information about me as well as the work that I
        have done. It is a portfolio that represents me.

      <h6>Goal Alignment</h6>

      <p>The goal behind my website is to act as a means by which people, such as future employers/companies who are scoping for people with the skills that I possess can truly learn more about me as a person, what I stand for, as well as view firsthand the projects that I have done through a creative lens (my website). Therefore, it was significant for me to design a website that was not only technical but stood as a mirror into my personality. Each design choice was made with careful thought and pure intention of representing my individuality. For example, the inclusion of pastel-coloured backgrounds with line drawings of flowers can indicate delicacy, femininity, and gentleness. 
        I want users to see my skills, experience, and education as well as some of the projects I have done because it is through these aspects that they get to learn a little more about me and come to know about my work ethic alongside my creativity. 
        I have created my website in such a way that makes it easy and comfortable for the users to traverse through it. I have placed the most important parts of my website like the about/profile section as the first aspect of the homepage. This decision allows users to access it in the most efficient way possible without making them go on a search for it. A button has been added to this section urging the user to view the webpage so that they may learn more about me. This has been done for each section being represented on the homepage. 
        Regarding this website the target audience/user would be people who want to get to know more about you either because you are starting a new business, or they are looking for people to hire. A website like this one is more about giving a good first impression so that the user may take away the type of character you have as well as the skills and passion you possess. the content of my website is information about me as well as the work that I have done. It is a portfolio that represents me.

      <h6>Notes on my visual aesthetic:</h6>
       <p> 	The Navbar – in my navbar on the top left corner I have added the name of my website in bold, gold letters. Next to it I added the logo of my website which is a line drawing of a woman holding flowers. Through this I hope to convey to my users that my website is one that exudes elegance, gentleness, and beauty. The gold lettering offers ideas of royalty but also compassion and success. The inclusion of a line drawing of a woman holding flowers indicates delicacy and femininity. 
        	The Backgrounds – I chose pastel-coloured backgrounds with line drawings of flowers to solidify and continue the idea of delicacy, femininity, and gentleness throughout my website. I believe such a choice offers comfort to the users making it a fun and creative yet beautiful space to be in. However, the use of a multicoloured pastel background adds a pop of colour to the hues of pink and white that are part of my website. It creates an artistic type of experience for the user because of the intricacy and vibrancy of it.
        Therefore, it can be deduced that the visual aesthetic I was aiming for with my website is an elegant, delicate, and beautiful website that users would enjoy using. However, it also conveys some of the things that I like. </p>
       
       <h6>Notes on visual design elements:</h6> 
       <p> 	Fonts – throughout my website I have decided to stick to one font as I believe it will enhance the unity throughout it. Therefore, my font of choice is cursive. I chose this font because well it is more interesting than a normal font it still offers great readability for the users which is vital to have in a website. It is also not so overwhelmingly fancy that it takes away from the meaning of the text because it would have been difficult to read. 
        	Readability and Legibility – As mentioned above the type of font impacts how your users understand your text as well as how easy you as the designer make it for your user to read. My website consists of good readability because the font is clear and concise. However, I have also ensured that I do not have large amounts of text in one place as this can overwhelm the user decreasing the readability of the content as well as the legibility. 
        	Colours – I have decided to use golds, pinks, whites and black as part of the design for my website. Gold is a colour that represents luxury, royalty, and elegance which is something that I want my website to convey. Pink can convey playfulness, peace, and softness. This plays an important role in displaying to my users that my website is a place of comfort and enjoyment. They can navigate my website with ease. The whites and blacks are used for the little details like borders and images as well as negative space. 
        	Colour theory and Relationships – In my website I make use of monochromatic colours as well as complementary colours. The monochromatic aspect includes my choice of using different shades of pink to indicate different aspects and interaction throughout my website while the goldish green is used throughout the textual elements mainly. The complementary colours come into play with the golds and pink. Gold and pink look great together creating an elegant and cohesive look. 
        	Hierarchy, Harmony, Balance – Throughout my website I have included the elements that I want the user to see at the top of each page. The use of the headings tags has also been helpful in indicating what holds more importance on each page. For example, h1 represents highly important/the main idea of the page while h6 represents a less important aspect of the page. I have included balance in my work by creating layouts that ensure there are an equal number of elements on each page. For example, on the Designs page I have images of the wireframes in rows of 3s which helps to balance out the page effectively. 
        	Shape, Colour, Position – I have implemented rounded rectangles/squares in my website. The rounded effect portrays a friendliness to my website that is not commanding or domineering. It creates ease within the website. The position of elements is placed in a very neat and cohesive way as to not cause confusion in the user of what they mean/represent.

      <h6>My Style Guide Documentation</h6>

      <p>
        My goal was to create a pretty, delicate, elegant website 
        that still served the purpose of being a portfolio website 
        which informed users about who I am and what skills I possess 
        well showcasing my creativity through some of the projects I have done. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned above I have decided to use a cursive font 
        throughout the website as with this style the characters are
         evenly spaced and become easily readable for the users. 
         They do not have to strain their eyes to understand what 
         each word means or is. I have decided to use the variations 
         of pink for most of my website and the variations of gold 
         for the textual elements. The gold I have decided to use is 
         like a greenish gold which pairs well with the light pinks 
         that I have implemented. All the information mentioned in 
         the style process documentation is what I have decided to 
         include in my website.
